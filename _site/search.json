Do the drill!\n\n\n\nExercise (to strengthen for this)\n\nLie on your back with your legs elevated about 90 degrees, hands on ground at side\nReach your feet up towards the ceiling, lifting your hips up from the ground\nDo this at least 15 times\nRepeat 2-4 times a day\nVariation: Try pushing up as if moving into single-leg X (both sides)\nVariation: Without hands on ground, lift hips and rotate sideways. Keep doing this round 360 degrees\n\n\n\nFollow-up to pull\n\nIn the event that your standing opponent resists your push and steps over your ankle hook:\nGrab the heel of their foot (the one that has stepped over) and lift it\nIf they fall over, great!\nOtherwise, react to what they do:\n\nMaybe move straight into single-leg X?\nOtherwise, stand up and keep hold of the foot"

As it comes away, shift your grip so both hands are on it, pushing it away and down so it’s almost straight\nNow quickly duck your head under it, pushing the arm out of the way while keeping your grip on it\nPushing the arm you’re holding towards their belly, spin towards them into their guard (here you can push with your feet)\nIf you’ve done this correctly you should be able to keep hold of their arm, putting you in a good position to escape the guard."

    "text": "Scarf hold\n\nThis is otherwise known as Kesa Gatame\nNot a super common position in grappling as it’s hard to submit from, but worth knowing\nThere are two escapes, depending on your opponent’s head position\n\n\nSit-through escape\n\nThis one works when their head is on the OTHER side from their leg on the floor (making it easier for them to hit you if this were self-defence)\nStep 1 self-defence: Don’t get punched - right hand on their bicep, arm slightly bent to prevent the punch\nStep 1 grappling - don’t get submitted - hide your arm by clasping hands behind their back\nStep 2: With your left hand, push their jaw firmly away from you, so that their body moves back. Make sure your fingers are pulled back to avoid bites or weirdness\nTake 3 steps away from them\n\nVersion 1 If they don’t follow you, you’ll feel their weight dropping off you\n\nSHRIMP slightly onto your side\nNow kick your legs outwards to swing yourself into a sitting position.\nYou can now move into side control or top turtle depending on position.\n\nVersion 2 If they DO follow you, you’ll feel their weight continue to be on top of you\n\nTake 1 or 2 steps back TOWARDS them\nReach back with your bottom hand (elbow on floor) and grab their leg (trouser leg OK)\nYou should now be able to lift their leg and tip them over, with you as the fulcrum. They should feel light.\nIf they avoid this by dropping their bum onto the floor, revert to version 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nSweep escape\n\nThere’s probably a better word for this one but I haven’t found it yet\nThis one works when their head is on the other side, close to their leg - this is a better pin, so more likely to occur in grappling\nStep 1 self-defence: again, don’t get punched - hold their bicep (remember don’t use your thumb)\nStep 1 grappling: don’t get submitted - hide your arm\nStep 2: turn onto your side, close to them\nClasp your hands firmly around their back\nBridge towards them, and while still up, roll over on your shoulders, sweeping them over\nYou should end up in a position to take back control or turtle\nFor self-defence, push up and move away\n\n\n\nPull your head out\n\nExtra escape if they resist the sweep by planting their feet firmly\nShrimp onto your side (CLOSE to them)\nShrimp again to bring yourself up onto your knees\nPull your head out from under their arm till it pops out"

Don’t think too hard about this one or you’ll get screwed up\nVersion 3: Move legs back and forth instead of left and right.\nVersion 4: If they push up to try and put their legs on your hips, you can do the classic bullfighter’s pass - push against them slightly then fling the legs aside like a bullfighter’s cape as you pass."

Do NOT ease pressure on the wrist\nYou should get a tap quite easily. If not, have you eased the wrist?\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this one when you DON’T get the arm all the way across AND they move forward and put their weight on you (e.g. their hand on your bicep)\nKeeping your grip on their armpit, let go the sleeve and reach around with your right hand to grab their gi at the knee\nPut your left foot on the floor. Use this to push your body around to the right.\nKick your right leg upwards towards the ceiling, sweeping them over as you do this so that you land in mount\nBen says this is the best sweep to try on your lover! It is quite fun.\nThis is a reasonable approximation of this sweep, although with slightly different grips.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this one where they don’t do anything after you get your grips\nOK, you wanna be choked then!\nReach up with your right hand and get a REALLY good grip on their gi, as far up as you can go behind their neck\nNow move your body and arm slightly to the right, forcing their neck upwards so you can reach under with your left hand\nGet a really good grip with your left hand as far up as you can go on the other side of their collar\nNow turn your palms UPWARDS, forcing your thumb-knuckles into their neck\nNow pull your elbows DOWN towards the ground (as if they can go through the ground), crunching up slightly but not too much (it’s mainly about bringing the elbows down, keeping them IN)\nYou should get a tap quite quickly"
