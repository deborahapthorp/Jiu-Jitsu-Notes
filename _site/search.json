    "text": "First, get posture: starting with head on opponent’s chest, place hands on their biceps, then move your hands downwards to place pressure on their lower ribs while working your way to an upright sitting posture.\nStep outwards with the left leg - remember to have leg as far back as possible to prevent opponent grabbing your ankle\nIf their ankles are still locked, push on their knee to break the grip\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as grip is broken, grab their legs in an under/over grip\nRemember to slouch down while doing this\nElbow IN!\n“Turn the wheel” to turn their hips\nPull their leg UNDER your left knee (do NOT lift your knee over!) - keep pressure on their leg\nLead with the hand - move your left hand under their head, while right hand moves to control their elbow\nAs you do this, you move the rest of your body into side control position - right knee to the hip, left leg extended\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly use this pass if your opponent resists, such than their leg does not hit the floor\nShrug your shoulders (remember to slouch!) so that your shoulder is now under their leg\nRight knee moves forward next to their hip\nReach forward to grab their gi (for no-gi, grab their shoulder if you can)\nKeeping your weight LOW and your head close to their shoulder, move around into side control position\nDo NOT lift your head!\nKeep the pressure down towards the hip until their leg slips over your head\nHands move into side control position - under head, controlling elbow.\nThis link is the closest I’ve found to a reasonable illustration of this pass.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is useful if both over- and under-leg passes have been successfully resisted (e.g. opponent is pinching their legs together)\nGrab both legs in an under-hook grip\nIf you can, grasp your hands together low around their hips (if not, you can do this later in the pass)\nNow walk you knees forwards until their bum is level with your belly button (keeping the grip or fixing it now)\nOnce you are in this position, pick a shoulder. Push your head downward towards this shoulder, reaching with the opposite hand (grab the gi lapel, or shoulder for no-gi)\nNow take two steps sideways to move around their body. Keep your head close to their shoulder as you do this, keeping the pressure on.\nAs in the single-under pass, eventually their leg will pop over your head (do NOT lift your head or take pressure off)\nAt this point, correct your posture and move around into side control - again, hand under head, other hand controls elbow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is sometimes called the “toureando/toreada” pass\nThis should be used if the opponent places their feet on the ground, or has the legs up between you in a defensive posture\nIf both feet are on the ground, place your hands on their knees and use this pressure to jump quickly up to your feet (knees bent), keeping close to their body\nIf knees are up, instead place your hands on their shins and use the downward pressure to spring upwards while controlling their legs\nSkip your left leg around their knee, then quickly follow with your right leg, moving smoothly to the knee ride position - 1-2-3."
