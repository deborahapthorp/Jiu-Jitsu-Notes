# Things we need to know for White Belt

## Closed guard - top - 4 passes 

- First, get posture: starting with head on opponent's chest, place hands on their biceps, then move your hands downwards to place pressure on their lower ribs while working your way to an upright sitting posture. 
- Step outwards with the left leg - remember to have leg as far back as possible to prevent opponent grabbing your ankle 
- If their ankles are still locked, push on their knee to break the grip 

### Over-leg pass

- As soon as grip is broken, grab their legs in an under/over grip 
- Remember to slouch down while doing this
- Elbow IN! 
- "Turn the wheel" to turn their hips
- Pull their leg UNDER your left knee (do NOT lift your knee over!) - keep pressure on their leg
- Lead with the hand - move your left hand under their head, while right hand moves to control their elbow
- As you do this, you move the rest of your body into side control position - right knee to the hip, left leg extended

### Under-leg pass 

- Only use this pass if your opponent resists, such than their leg does not hit the floor 
- Shrug your shoulders (remember to slouch!) so that your shoulder is now under their leg 
- Right knee moves forward next to their hip 
- Reach forward to grab their gi (for no-gi, grab their shoulder if you can)
- Keeping your weight LOW and your head close to their shoulder, move around into side control position 
- Do NOT lift your head! 
- Keep the pressure down towards the hip until their leg slips over your head
- Hands move into side control position - under head, controlling elbow. 
- [This link is the closest I've found to a reasonable illustration of this pass.](https://www.ultimatejujitsu.com/learn-jujitsu-techniques/brazilian-jiu-jitsu-techniques/escapes/passing-the-guard/)

### Double under-leg pass 

- This is useful if both over- and under-leg passes have been successfully resisted (e.g. opponent is pinching their legs together)
- Grab both legs in an under-hook grip 
- If you can, grasp your hands together low around their hips (if not, you can do this later in the pass)
- Now walk you knees forwards until their bum is level with your belly button (keeping the grip or fixing it now)
- Once you are in this position, pick a shoulder. Push your head downward towards this shoulder, reaching with the opposite hand (grab the gi lapel, or shoulder for no-gi)
- Now take two steps sideways to move around their body. Keep your head close to their shoulder as you do this, keeping the pressure on. 
- As in the single-under pass, eventually their leg will pop over your head (do NOT lift your head or take pressure off)
- At this point, correct your posture and move around into side control - again, hand under head, other hand controls elbow. 

### "Dancing" pass 

- This one is sometimes called the "toureando/toreada" pass 
- This should be used if the opponent places their feet on the ground, or has the legs up between you in a defensive posture
- If both feet are on the ground, place your hands on their knees and use this pressure to jump quickly up to your feet (knees bent), keeping close to their body
- If knees are up, instead place your hands on their shins and use the downward pressure to spring upwards while controlling their legs 
- Skip your left leg around their knee, then quickly follow with your right leg, moving smoothly to the knee ride position - 1-2-3. 

## Guard - bottom - two sweeps, two submissions

### Scissor sweep

- You have the opponent in your closed guard, and they either haven't sat up yet or you have pulled them back down with your legs (e.g. after knocking their hands away)
- This sweep is preferred in gi, less so in no-gi because the timing is more critical 
- Grab their gi lapel (or, in no-gi, the back of their head)
- As you do this, place your left foot on the ground, right leg between you, and pull them forward so that their weight is balanced on your shin
- Once they are in this position, scissor your legs quickly so that they topple over to one side. 
- As they do this, your weight follows theirs (keep your grips!) so that you easily roll over into mount 
- Make sure to finish in the correct mount position with your hands on the floor.

### Hip bump sweep

- This one is used when your opponent is sitting up and perhaps leaning backwards a bit to avoid being pulled forwards by you 
- From the bottom guard position, reach one hand over the opposite shoulder (you need to be able to do this on both sides), and sit up into the opponent's lap. As you do this, bump them with your hip so that they fall backwards into your mount
- Make sure to finish in mount position properly with your hands on the floor.
