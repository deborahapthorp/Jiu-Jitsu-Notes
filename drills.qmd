## Solo turtle drill 

- Start in turtle position, forehead on floor, arms protecting head
- Move one arm outwards, placing palm on the floor, elbow up
- Sit through to the side opposite that arm, rotating through 90 degrees (if you had an opponent, you would now be facing into them). 
- You are now more or less in butterfly guard 
- Now tuck one knee close to your body (the opposite knee to the arm you just used)
- Push yourself upwards with a hip thrust so that you are now on one knee and one foot
- Move back into turtle position and start again (going the other way, back to the direction you started in)
- This is good for core strength and can be done in a small space


## Grip fighting drill (no-gi)

- We learned this drill in January 2024 (week 3 of training)
- One participant sits in butterfly guard (knees apart and bent, feet somewhat towards your body, core engaged, back curved)
- Participant 2 is standing with right foot forward, ready to drive forward from the ball of the back foot
- The aim of the game for standing participant is to do one of 3 things: 
  - Push sitting participant over with a quick shove to the shoulders (must be firm)
  - Tip sitting participant over by grabbing their heels and lifting
  - Place pressure on sitting participant's knees
- The aim of the game for the sitting participant is to do one of 3 things: 
  - Grab both wrists of standing participant: either under, over, or one of each (depending on position)
  - Grab one wrist of standing participant with both hands (baseball bat grip)
  - Grab one wrist and the same upper arm in a bent position (this is the strongest position)

- Can move from one position to another
- Do not CHEAT as standing participant by hiding your hands (sitting participant could then grab your feet/ankles)

## Push-pull drill from butterfly guard 

- This follows on from the previous game 
- This is more a drill than a game 
- Start from the point where you have a double-wrist grip from butterfly
- It doesn't have to be a double-wrist grip! Single-wrist will work! 
- Bottom person pulls on the standing person's wrists
- Standing person reacts by stepping forward, crouching down somewhat

### Pull

- This works when the standing person then reacts by pulling back
- From butterfly, hook the standing person's ankles with your feet 
- Don't sit back
- Keep the feet active, in contact with their heels 
- Then push on their knees (use body, not just arms)
- Standing person will fall backwards

### Push 

- This works when standing person does not pull back
- Keep hold of their right wrist; with your left hand, grab their upper right leg
- Pull yourself under their hips (do NOT fall backwards yet)
- Hook your left foot up begind their right leg, up around their hip
- To do this you have gone onto your back and lifted your hips upwards
- Twisting around somewhat, pinch their leg between yours (your right leg is at the front)
- Grab your left butt cheek around their ankle to squeeze the leg in
- To sweep them, lift and twist sideways 
- Need core strength for this! Do the drill! 

### Exercise (to strengthen for this)

- Lie on your back with your legs elevated about 90 degrees, hands on ground at side
- Reach your feet up towards the ceiling, lifting your hips up from the ground
- Do this at least 15 times 
- Repeat 2-4 times a day
- Variation: Try pushing up as if moving into single-leg X (both sides)
- Variation: Without hands on ground, lift hips and rotate sideways. Keep doing this round 360 degrees

### Follow-up to pull

- In the event that your standing opponent resists your push and steps over your ankle hook: 
- Grab the heel of their foot (the one that has stepped over) and lift it 
- If they fall over, great! 
- Otherwise, react to what they do:
  - Maybe move straight into single-leg X? 
  - Otherwise, stand up and keep hold of the foot 


## Moving around in butterfly guard drill 

- The great strength of butterfly is the flexibility it gives you to move 
- Practice moving around from butterfly
  - With one hand behind you, the other between you and your imaginary opponent, move around 
  - Move around with fists on floor, but keep leaning forwards
  - "Levitate" by moving forwards or around without using hands at all
