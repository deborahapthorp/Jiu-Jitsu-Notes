## Solo turtle drill 

- Start in turtle position, forehead on floor, arms protecting head
- Move one arm outwards, placing palm on the floor, elbow up
- Sit through to the side opposite that arm, rotating through 90 degrees (if you had an opponent, you would now be facing into them). 
- You are now more or less in butterfly guard 
- Now tuck one knee close to your body (the opposite knee to the arm you just used)
- Push yourself upwards with a hip thrust so that you are now on one knee and one foot
- Move back into turtle position and start again (going the other way, back to the direction you started in)
- This is good for core strength and can be done in a small space


## Grip fighting drill (no-gi)

- We learned this drill in January 2024 (week 3 of training)
- One participant sits in butterfly guard (knees apart and bent, feet somewhat towards your body, core engaged, back curved)
- Participant 2 is standing with right foot forward, ready to drive forward from the ball of the back foot
- The aim of the game for standing participant is to do one of 3 things: 
  - Push sitting participant over with a quick shove to the shoulders (must be firm)
  - Tip sitting participant over by grabbing their heels and lifting
  - Place pressure on sitting participant's knees
- The aim of the game for the sitting participant is to do one of 3 things: 
  - Grab both wrists of standing participant: either under, over, or one of each (depending on position)
  - Grab one wrist of standing participant with both hands (baseball bat grip)
  - Grab one wrist and the same upper arm in a bent position (this is the strongest position)
  - Can move from one position to another
- Do not CHEAT as standing participant by hiding your hands (sitting participant could then grab your feet/ankles)
