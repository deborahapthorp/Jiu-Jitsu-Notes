title: "Jiu Jitsu Notes"
---

This is a Quarto website I have built to keep track of my (very rudimentary) progress in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I am a simple white belt working towards my third stripe, and I'm creating the site to help keep in my memory the things I need to know. 

I train in Armidale with Tim Jones from [Black Cockatoo Martial Arts](https://blackcockatoomartialarts.com.au/#self-defence). 

CAVEAT: I am not in any way a trained instructor, and no one who accidentally stumbles upon this site should take anything on here as training advice. This is purely a set of notes for my own use and, potentially, for my training partners to add to if they so choose.
