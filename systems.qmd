# Background 

Here I will document some rudimentary systems for attacks and sweeps that Tim is showing us

## Attacks from closed guard

- First, get your grips. Right hand goes into their sleeve in a pistol grip, thumb inside 
- Left hand reaches across under their arm, grabbing the seam so you have a good hold
- While you're doing this, keep them down firmly with your knees! 
- Lift your hips quickly to jolt them
- As you do this, pull their arm firmly with your right hand to try and get it across your hips

### Arm bar 

- Use this one when you can get their arm straight across your hips 
- Lift your hips again and swing your left leg up over their shoulder as you move your body to the right 
- You can use your other leg against them as leverage
- Quickly cross your ankles again if you can
- Now you can let go of their armpit and push their head down under your leg as you shift your body a bit further across 
- Bring your hands both to their wrist, grasping wrist to your chest, pulling their arm straight
- Your thumbs are pointing up
- Left leg scissors down over their head so it's grasping the head, knee points up 
- Now lift your hips in the direction your knee is pointing, UP. Do NOT ease pressure on the wrist 
- You should get a tap quite easily. If not, have you eased the wrist? 

### Flower sweep

- Use this one when you DON'T get the arm all the way across AND they move forward and put their weight on you (e.g. their hand on your bicep)
- Keeping your grip on their armpit, let go the sleeve and reach around with your right hand to grab their gi at the knee 
- Put your left foot on the floor. Use this to push your body around to the right.
- Kick your right leg upwards towards the ceiling, sweeping them over as you do this so that you land in mount 
- Ben says this is the best sweep to try on your lover! It is quite fun. 
- [This is a reasonable approximation of this sweep](https://jiujitsulegacy.com/videos/how-to-flower-sweep-from-closed-guard/), although with slightly different grips. 

### Cross-collar choke 

- Use this one where they don't do anything after you get your grips
- OK, you wanna be choked then! 
- Reach up with your right hand and get a REALLY good grip on their gi, as far up as you can go behind their neck 
- Now move your body and arm slightly to the right, forcing their neck upwards so you can reach under with your left hand
- Get a really good grip with your left hand as far up as you can go on the other side of their collar
- Now turn your palms UPWARDS, forcing your thumb-knuckles into their neck 
- Now pull your elbows DOWN towards the ground (as if they can go through the ground), crunching up slightly but not too much (it's mainly about bringing the elbows down, keeping them IN)
- You should get a tap quite quickly
